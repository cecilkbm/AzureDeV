# AzureDeV
VNET Peering Project

Lab scenario
Your organization has three datacenters connected with a mesh wide-area network. As the Azure Administrator, you need to implement the on-premises infrastructure in Azure.
	• There are two offices, New York and Boston, in one region.
	• There's one office, Seattle, in another region.
	• All the offices need to be networked together so they can share information.
	• This simulation focuses on the connectivity of the offices, and not creating the individual Azure resources.


Task 1: Create the infrastructure environment. In this task, you deploy three virtual machines. Virtual machines are deployed in different regions and virtual networks.
 
Task 2: Configure local and global virtual network peering.
Create a local virtual network peering between the two virtual networks in the same region.
Create a global virtual network peering between virtual networks in different regions.

Task 3: Test intersite connectivity between virtual machines on the three virtual networks.
Test the virtual machine connections in the same region.
Test the virtual machine connections in different regions.
